-- An example that tries to demonstrate funny business.  The 'f'
-- function will escape its context by being stored in the data
-- structure.  We are trying to find an example where it matters
-- whether the binding for 'f' is inside or outside the push 'g'.

-- Unfortunately this one doesn't work (or rather, it works fine, but
-- doesn't demonstrate a problem.  Again, eval4 is the only semantics
-- that works here.
